# Good day!

Welcome to my humble self-made Messaging Web Application! This project aims to improve my Web Application development skills. In addition, perfect my **JavaScript** capabilities. Updates on this project will be logged each time it is pushed on GitHub, consult the version history for detailed information! *-Zach*

## How to run

1. Move `cd` to the **backapp** folder. 
2. Run `nodemon server` or simply `node server`
3. Move `cd` out to the main folder and then into **frontapp** folder.
4. Run `npm start` or build it with `npm run build`. If optimized build is preferred, after the build is done, run it with `serve -s build`!
